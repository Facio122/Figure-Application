# FigureApp
This is my Mobile App using Kotlin language in Android Studio environment. In this app user can manage figures and perform actions like: add figures, removes them from list, set figure parameters etc. 
The application is adjust to screen rotation.
Making the app taught me:
- using Android Studio
- data migration between activities (by bundle(), Singletons), 
- handling views
